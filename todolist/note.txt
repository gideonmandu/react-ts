memo :
Memorizes a component
Re-memorizes when props change
Avoids re-renders
useMemo :
Memorizes a calculated value
For computed properties
For heavy processes
useCallback :
Memorizes a function definition to avoid redefining it on each render.
Use it whenever a function is passed as an effect argument.
Use it whenever a function is passed by props to a memorized component.
And finally, do not forget the golden rule: Do not use them until absolutely necessary.
